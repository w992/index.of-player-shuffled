# Index.Of Music Player
A bookmarklet to play songs on the webbrowser's "Index Of" page.

After loading a directory in your browser and loading the bookmarklet, click on a song and it will play in the player that is stuck to the top of the page. Next song is random, or click on another song.

Make sure void(0) is still there after compressing the code, as some compressors remove it.
